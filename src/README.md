# Project Code

This folder contains scripts to reproduce the plots in the paper. Apart from that `MultiFidwDFT.py` is used to train the GP model, `ExtractingMFGPParameters.ipynb` is used to extract the learned parameters from the trained model, `MFMAECalc.ipynb` is used to calculate the SMAE for the Multi-fidelity model while `StandardMAE.ipynb` is used to calculate the SMAE for the Standard GP.
